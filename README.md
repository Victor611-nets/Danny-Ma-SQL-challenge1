🍜 Danny's Diner SQL Challenge
This repository contains my solution to the Danny's Diner SQL challenge, part of Danny Ma's 8-Week SQL Challenge. This case study is focused on analyzing customer dining behavior using SQL.

📝 Challenge Overview
Danny operates a small restaurant and wants to gain insights into customer visits, order patterns, and spending habits. The dataset provided includes information about customers, menu items, and transactions. The challenge involves writing SQL queries to answer a set of business questions based on this data.

📂 Case Study #1: Danny’s Diner
Datasets
sales: Records of customer purchases.

menu: Menu items and their prices.

members: Loyalty program membership info.

Business Questions
The challenge includes the following questions:

  1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?

  2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?

  3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?

  4.What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?

  5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?

  6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?

  7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?

  8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?

  9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
  
  10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?
